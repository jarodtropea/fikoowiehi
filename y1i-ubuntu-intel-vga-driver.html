                            <p>Мне интересно, есть ли что-нибудь, чтобы отключить intel gpu на ubuntu 12.04. Я хочу иметь возможность настроить двойной монитор, используя настройки nvidia.

Драйвер графической подсистемы Intel является частью пакета драйверов xserver-xorg-video-intel, который по умолчанию устанавливается на всех системах Ubuntu. Устанавливал и пробовал настроить как Ubuntu 12.04 так и Ubuntu 13.04 со 16.580 (II) fglrx: intel VGA device detected, load intel driver. В Ubuntu по умолчанию уже установлен драйвер видеокарт Intel. I have AMD R7 M265 Graphic card on my Dell Inspiron 15 5448, I am currently running Ubuntu 17.10 and am unable to use my Graphic card as there are issues with the combination. I learned same is the issue with Fedora. Has anyone been successful in installing drivers for this particular hardware on any Linux at all. If yes, please tell me how. I do not intend to use Windows Вобщем у кого всё нормально (или хотябы частично ускорение или вертикальная синхронизация) работает с этим Intel HD, напишите какая у вас версия Ubuntu, ядра, как ставили драйвера. Hello there ! I have just received my new Dell XPS 9380, pre-installed with ubuntu 18.04. It's awesome and everything seems to be running smoothly except for two things : Sometimes typing in a terminal will freeze the system for 3-4 seconds. (I can see the clock stopped in the top bar). Then the letters typed during this interval will appear all at once. It seems that it happens mainly after maintaining backspace to delete something, but it's hard to reproduce consistently. Для Ubuntu существует неофициальный репозиторий, в котором выкладываются новые версии драйверов, это драйверы собранные из исходников с сайта Nvidia упакованные в deb пакеты.  
Hi everyone, I'm sharing my story as I still can't believe whats going on. So this year I decided I was going to build a top tier gaming rig Intel I9 9900k Asus 2080 TI Asus Z390-i Corsair RM850X Patriot Viper 16gb NZXT Kraken X42 I finished building my machine and after goofing around for a bit I decided to test for stability just in case. I ran Prime95 and before 5 minutes went by the computer restarted with no blue screens or nothing just restarted. 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82945G /GZ Видимо драйвер Intel ненадёжен, если месяц аптайма не выдерживает. Hi all - I'm new to VFIO, and trying to debug why GPU Passthrough is failing for me. Wondering if anyone here more experienced with VFIO can shed some light on this. I've heard about the Vega reset issue, but not sure if this is related? I'm attempting to passthrough the single GPU I have in my build. (a Vega56) to a Linux guest through KVM (Using virt-install) The host has a monitor attached to the GPU I'm trying to passthrough, and all of the below has been retrieved Все! Система готова к использованию! Вытаскиваем флешку с LiveUSB и заходим в UEFI и запускаем Ubuntu так же, как и LiveUSB. I'm using Linux Mint, but I assume it's fine to ask for a bit of help here too.? I've decided to move from Windows to Linux Mint 19.1 (based on Ubuntu 18.04), installation went just fine. The only problem I'm facing is with my ethernet connection - PC recognizes that it has ethernet, but won't connect to a network, it would just try to connect infinitely. The device in question is Realtek RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet. By default it was using the r8169 driver Скачать driver san francisco eng.

So i will try my best to explain how to properly use dedicated gpu's for avoiding performance issues. I'm not a native speaker , so bare with my somewhat broken English. Guide will be centric to Ubuntu 18.04 base ( since i'm on Mint 19.1 ) , especially for Nvidia Prime.

So, i am using a lenovo laptop (core i5 4200m, nvidia 770m gtx+ intel 4600hd) with win 7 64bits. I have it connected to a samsung 31khz crt monitor using vga. I downloaded the latest retroarch and followed this tutorial here https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/6aaw88/guide_how_to_run_retroarch_in_240p_on_your_vga/ Because my laptop doesnt allow me to add custom.

Hi, Recently my Claymore 11.9 miner stopped recognizing RX580 on my Ubuntu 16.04 machine. I was using it with amdgpu-pro 17.40 --compute driver installation. When running it, I get: `No AMD OPENCL or NVIDIA CUDA GPUs found, exit` Before the card was running ok, and the card is still running fine of Windows. What could be wrong? Thank you!

I was playing Oblivion under wine in my Debian Stretch install. It worked perfectly with high details and smooth graphics, all I had to do is download d3dx9 using winetricks (because of the black skin bug (https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20074)) and tick the box 'emulate a virtual desktop'.

I've recently built a new pc rig. I installed both Linux Mint 19.1 and Windows 10. Upon booting into Linux Mint, Cinnamon displayed the warning about rendering in software. When I launched Device Manager to install the Nvidia drivers, they weren't there. Nothing was. The onboard Intel graphics works fine. I tried installing the nvidia driver 390, but that didn't work. Any ideas how to get the Nvidia card to work properly? System: cpu: i7 8700k mobo: Taichi Ultimate ram: 32gb pc3200 stora. Hi! I have my log file uploaded to file.io, here. (https://file.io/5m8iGy) The system has been running great for a few days, and I went to reboot today and can't get things back on. I've upgraded a lot of packages, and I was going back and forth on some graphic card drivers (see this post here, where I got some help on Civ 6 (https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/a8wjwv/civilization_vi_does_not_load_with_amdgpupro/)). There are some errors in the log file related to ExtraHDD So, I previously had a working configuration that allowed me to pass my GTX 1080 to a VM with no issue, I recently reinstalled linux, after adding more hardware, moving from vanilla ubuntu to ubuntu-mate. I'm sure some have noticed the SoundBlaster in my hardware list, I have working drivers for it under linux, if I pass through the soundcard by itself the VM will return the card back to the host once the VM shuts down or crashes.
